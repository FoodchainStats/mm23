The ONS Shopping Price tool is a new data source published in [May
2023](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/shoppingpricescomparisontool/2023-05-03).
`mm23` contains some experimental functions to download and wrangle the
underlying dataset.

## Getting shopping price data

Download the latest data from ONS. `acquire_prices()` simply downloads the full
latest data download file, and returns its location. By default it puts it into a
temporary file, but you can specify where you want to put it.

As of June 2023, its not clear if the url for the data is stable.
`acquire_prices()` uses `prices_url()` for its download target. This may have to
change.
