## Introduction

The price quote functions will generally access and download the price quote
data, but changes to the variables over the years and the nature of the data
means that you'll probably have to do some wrangling to get what you need -
assuming what youtre interested in is the average retail price of stuff. The relevant functioons are:

 * `make_cpi_quote_archive()` for historic data, and
 * `get_cpi_price_quotes()` for the latest

#### Historic data

The `make_cpi_quote_archive()` will generate a large rds file with all the price
quote data available from the CPI price quotes page for 2010 - 2019. This page
is accessible from `cpi_price_quotes_url()`. For data from 2020 onwards, use
`get_cpi_price_quotes()`. The main thing is to filter by validity, which is
numeric until Feb 2025, when it becomes TRUE/FALSE. So it might bepreferaebl to
make a distinction.


```{r}
mm23::get_cpi_price_quotes(2021, 6) |> dplyr::slice_sample(n = 5) |> t() |> knitr::kable()
```


### Latest (post Jan 2025) data

```{r}
mm23::get_cpi_price_quotes(2025, 3) |> dplyr::slice_sample(n = 5) |> t() |> knitr::kable()
```
